# steg

A thoughtfully designed goal tracking system that supports daily, weekly,
monthly, and annual goals. Focused on clean design and meaningful interactions.

## What is steg?

steg (/steÀê…°/) is a goal tracking app built for people who appreciate clean
design and thoughtful interactions. It strips away the complexity found in most
habit trackers to focus on what matters: your progress.

This isn't just another cluttered productivity app. It's a carefully crafted
tool that includes:

### Goal Types & Tracking

- **Countable Goals**: Track numerical targets with animated progress indicators
- **Yes/No Goals**: Simple completion tracking with daily streaks
- Support for daily habits, weekly targets, monthly milestones, and annual
  objectives

### Smart Reminders

- Context-aware notifications that know when you need them:
  - Daily goals check for today's completion
  - Weekly goals remind you on Thursday if behind
  - Monthly goals alert on the 25th if off track
  - Annual goals compare to expected pace

## Philosophy

While most tracking apps overwhelm you with features, steg embraces minimalism
in both design and function. Every element serves a purpose, from the circular
progress indicators to the mathematically spaced grid layouts.

The goal isn't to gamify your habits - it's to provide a calm, focused space for
tracking what matters to you. Simple to use, but thoughtfully crafted.
